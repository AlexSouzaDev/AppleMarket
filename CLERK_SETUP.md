# Clerk Authentication Setup Instructions

## Overview
This Next.js application now has Clerk authentication integrated to protect the main page and other routes. Users must sign in before accessing protected content.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create Clerk Account and Application
1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
2. Create a new account or sign in
3. Create a new application
4. Choose your preferred authentication methods (email, social logins, etc.)

### 2. Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with the following variables:

```env
# Clerk Authentication
# Get these values from your Clerk Dashboard (https://dashboard.clerk.com)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key_here

# Clerk URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/
```

**Important:** Replace `your_clerk_publishable_key_here` and `your_clerk_secret_key_here` with your actual keys from the Clerk Dashboard.

### 3. How It Works

#### Protected Routes
- **Main page (`/`)**: Protected by middleware and server-side auth check
- **Middleware**: Automatically redirects unauthenticated users to sign-in
- **Server-side protection**: Additional auth check in the main page component

#### Authentication Flow
1. User visits the main page
2. Middleware checks authentication status
3. If not authenticated, redirects to `/sign-in`
4. User signs in through Clerk's UI
5. After successful authentication, redirects back to main page
6. User can now access protected content

#### Components Added
- **Sign-in page**: `/sign-in` - Clerk's sign-in component
- **Sign-up page**: `/sign-up` - Clerk's sign-up component
- **UserButton**: Added to Header component for user management
- **ClerkProvider**: Wraps the entire app in layout.tsx

### 4. Running the Application
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Set up your `.env.local` file with Clerk keys
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
5. You'll be redirected to sign-in if not authenticated

### 5. Customization Options

#### Adding More Protected Routes
To protect additional routes, update the `isProtectedRoute` matcher in `middleware.ts`:

```typescript
const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher([
  '/',
  '/dashboard(.*)',
  '/profile(.*)',
  '/your-new-route(.*)', // Add new routes here
])
```

#### Customizing Authentication UI
- Modify sign-in/sign-up pages in `src/app/sign-in/` and `src/app/sign-up/`
- Customize Clerk components with appearance settings
- Add custom styling to match your app's design

#### User Management
The `UserButton` component in the header provides:
- User profile access
- Sign out functionality
- Account management options

### 6. Security Features
- **Route protection**: Middleware-level protection
- **Server-side validation**: Additional auth checks in components
- **Automatic redirects**: Seamless user experience
- **Session management**: Handled by Clerk automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Missing publishable key" error**: Ensure your `.env.local` file has the correct Clerk keys
2. **Redirect loops**: Check that your Clerk URLs in environment variables are correct
3. **Styling issues**: Clerk components come with default styling that can be customized
